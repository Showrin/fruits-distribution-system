This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. First, create a file called `.env.local` and copy the content of `.env.example` into it. Then change the values if needed.

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the app in http://localhost:3000.
